# Sandrun

> **Anonymous, ephemeral, sandboxed code execution service**

Sandrun provides secure, isolated code execution without user accounts or data persistence. Submit code, get results, everything auto-deletes. Simple, private, secure.

## What is Sandrun?

Sandrun is a **lightweight batch job execution system** that runs untrusted code in hardware-enforced isolation. Built on Linux security primitives (namespaces, seccomp-BPF, cgroups), it provides:

- **True anonymity**: No signup, no authentication, no user tracking
- **Complete isolation**: Each job runs in its own sandbox with restricted syscalls
- **Automatic cleanup**: All data lives in RAM and auto-deletes after use
- **Fair resource sharing**: IP-based rate limiting prevents abuse while ensuring access
- **Multi-language support**: Python, JavaScript, Bash, Ruby, R, and more
- **Production-ready**: Distributed execution via pool coordinator, signed results, WebSocket streaming

Perfect for ephemeral compute needs, privacy-preserving analysis, untrusted code execution, and distributed batch processing.

## Key Features

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo apt-get install libseccomp-dev libcap-dev libssl-dev

# Build
cmake -B build
cmake --build build

# Run server (requires root for namespaces)
sudo ./build/sandrun --port 8443
```

### Submit Your First Job

```bash
# Create a simple Python script
echo 'print("Hello, Sandrun!")' > hello.py

# Package and submit
tar czf job.tar.gz hello.py
curl -X POST http://localhost:8443/submit \
  -F "files=@job.tar.gz" \
  -F 'manifest={"entrypoint":"hello.py","interpreter":"python3"}'

# Response:
# {"job_id":"job-abc123","status":"queued"}

# Check status
curl http://localhost:8443/status/job-abc123

# Get logs
curl http://localhost:8443/logs/job-abc123
```

## Use Cases

### For Individuals
- **Privacy-Preserving Analysis** - Process sensitive data without leaving traces
- **Testing Untrusted Code** - Run code from the internet safely in isolation
- **Quick Prototyping** - Execute code snippets without local environment setup
- **Learning & Education** - Experiment with code in a safe sandbox

### For Teams & Organizations
- **Distributed Batch Processing** - Scale compute across multiple workers
- **CI/CD Pipeline Integration** - Execute test suites or build jobs in isolated environments
- **Anonymous Job Submission** - Process user-submitted code without authentication overhead
- **Multi-tenant Compute** - Provide code execution as a service with strong isolation

### For AI & LLM Integration
- **AI Code Execution** - Let LLMs like Claude execute code safely via MCP protocol
- **Data Analysis Workflows** - Enable AI assistants to run pandas, numpy, or R code
- **Automated Testing** - LLMs can test their own generated code

## Real-World Examples

!!! example "Quick Python Script"
    ```bash
    # Create a simple analysis script
    echo 'import statistics; print(statistics.mean([1,2,3,4,5]))' > analyze.py

    # Package and submit
    tar czf job.tar.gz analyze.py
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8443/submit \
      -F "files=@job.tar.gz" \
      -F 'manifest={"entrypoint":"analyze.py","interpreter":"python3"}'

    # Output: {"job_id":"job-abc123","status":"queued"}
    ```

!!! example "Multi-file ML Project"
    ```bash
    # Project structure:
    # project/
    # ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train.py
    # ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ model.py
    # ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data.csv
    # ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt

    tar czf project.tar.gz -C project .
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8443/submit \
      -F "files=@project.tar.gz" \
      -F 'manifest={
        "entrypoint":"train.py",
        "interpreter":"python3",
        "requirements":"requirements.txt",
        "outputs":["model.pkl","metrics.json"],
        "timeout":600,
        "memory_mb":1024
      }'
    ```

!!! example "Real-time Log Streaming"
    ```javascript
    // Watch logs in real-time via WebSocket
    const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8443/logs/job-abc123/stream');
    ws.onmessage = (event) => {
      console.log(event.data);  // Prints logs as they happen
    };
    ```

## Security Model

!!! warning "Security Boundaries"
    Sandrun provides strong isolation for **untrusted code execution** but relies on the Linux kernel. Always run on updated systems with kernel security patches.

**What Sandrun Protects Against:**
- Filesystem access outside the sandbox
- Network access from jobs
- Process interference between jobs
- Memory disclosure between jobs
- Persistence of job data after completion

**What Sandrun Does NOT Protect Against:**
- Kernel vulnerabilities (keep your kernel updated!)
- Timing attacks between concurrent jobs
- Covert channels via CPU cache timing
- Physical hardware attacks
