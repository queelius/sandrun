Hands-on, practical tutorials that guide you through building real-world applications with Sandrun.

## Available Tutorials

### [Distributed Data Pipeline](distributed-data-pipeline.md)

**Level:** Beginner to Advanced | **Time:** 45-60 minutes

Learn to build a complete data processing pipeline from scratch. This comprehensive tutorial progressively teaches:

- **Part 1:** Simple data analysis with Python
- **Part 2:** Multi-file projects with dependencies
- **Part 3:** Using pre-built environments for performance
- **Part 4:** Processing multiple datasets
- **Part 5:** Distributed execution with trusted pools
- **Part 6:** Real-time monitoring with WebSocket streaming
- **Part 7:** Cryptographic result verification
- **Part 8:** Complete production pipeline

**What You'll Build:** A distributed system that analyzes sales data across multiple workers with real-time monitoring and verified results.

**Prerequisites:**
- Sandrun server running locally
- Python 3.8+
- Basic Python and pandas knowledge
- curl and jq installed

## Tutorial Philosophy

Our tutorials follow these principles:

1. **Hands-on and Practical** - You build real projects, not toy examples
2. **Progressive Complexity** - Start simple, gradually add advanced features
3. **Production-Ready** - Learn patterns used in real deployments
4. **Complete Examples** - All code provided, copy-paste friendly
5. **Checkpoint System** - Regular validation of your progress

## Coming Soon

We're planning tutorials on:

- **Machine Learning with Sandrun** - Train and deploy models safely
- **Privacy-Preserving Analytics** - Process sensitive data without persistence
- **LLM Code Execution** - Build AI assistants with MCP integration
- **GPU Workloads** - Deep learning and image processing pipelines
